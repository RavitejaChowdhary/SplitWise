A home page where we can see some details about the website like services, portfolio and
contact details along with that we added signup and login functionalities so that each user has
access to his account by entering his/her username and password. While taking the details of
the user, the user has to fill the form in a way that all the fields should be matched to sign up,
so after getting details we are validating the details so that all the data entered are secured and
are in a proper format. While signing up user also has to upload an image of him/her, so that it
can be used in further pages to show his profile and this photo will be saved in the server under
the folder photos by the filename registration number of the user.
When user already had an account before he/she not required to sign in, he/she can directly go
to login page by clicking login button from home page, then the page will be redirected to login
page. Now after entering the username and password, when user clicks submit then the
username and password will be checked from the users database, if the user exists and entered
correct password, user will be redirected to dash board where he/she can see all his/her
expenses, activities done by the user.
After login, he can also add expenses by clicking add expense button and selecting the people
who joined in that activity and giving some description about the activity and amount paid by
you, when user adding each other participant, our site will instantly display the amount that has
to be paid by each user. After clicking save button then the activity details will be stored in the
database. On the right side of the page, he can to how many people he/she has to give money
and also he/she can see how many amount he/she has to be received from the other persons
along with the amount and also, user can see how much user has to send and how much total
amount he /she has to be received form the user by fetching all the details from the database
and displaying it with a good looking interface.
If the other user who given the owed amount, then he can settle that expense by clicking settle
expense and selecting the user who paid you the amount you have to be receive a, then that
amount will be settled among the users. In the dashboard we made a dropdown list in such a
way user can see his or her profile and also can logout. When user clicks profile, then it will
redirect to the new page, where user can able to see all his details which were given during the
signup and updated details.
User can also update his profile from the profile page itself by clicking edit profile, then it will

will be redirected to the login page again and all the above functionalities can be done by the
